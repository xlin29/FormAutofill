## Extension
A chrome extension that detects autofillable, hidden elements in a visitied page. It shows a warning message on **lax mode**, and remove these hidden elements on **strict mode**.

## Attack demos
A novel, complicated side-channel attack that exploits browserâ€™s autofill preview functionality to infer information in user's profile.

### Inter from multiple profiles

1. multiple_emails.html: obtain the email addresses from multiple profiles in the autofill

### Infer with 100k candidate values
1. preview_cc.html: infer user's credit card number (100k candidate values).

2. preview_phone.html: infer user's phone number (100k candidate values).

## Crawler
The crawler is ruuning on top of Selenium and an intrumented chromium/firefox.

## Data
In a crawl conducted during November 2019, these web pages were found to have hidden HTML elements autofilled by Chrome/Firefox.
